    "A batch workflow involves taking a job and breaking it down into a series of discrete tasks. As an example, consider the typical daily morning routine many people have for getting ready to go to work or school. A typical morning routine involves multiple tasks that must be executed in a certain order. The following is a list is a notional morning routine broken down into discrete tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Wake up\n",
    "- Exercise\n",
    "- Get out of bed\n",
    "- Make bed\n",
    "- Eat breakfast\n",
    "- Brush teeth\n",

    "- Get dressed\n",
    "- Comb hair\n",
    "- Listen to a news podcast\n",
    "- Lock the doors\n",
    "- Drive to work\n",
    "- Arrive at work\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these tasks depend on the successful execution of other tasks. All of these tasks depend on waking up in the morning. As such, waking up is the first task in the workflow. Other tasks have an obvious order. It makes logical sense that you would shower after exercising and that you would probably want to brush your teeth after you eat breakfast. Other task dependencies are less strict. You can listen to your news podcast any time after you wake up. Likewise, you can make your bed anytime before locking the doors and driving to work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a series of tasks, we wanted to create a workflow that describes the dependencies between each task. Typically, we define a batch workflow in terms of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of tasks. In computer science, a graph is a collection of nodes connected by vertices. In the case of a workflow, the nodes are tasks and the connections are task dependencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "Workflows are *directed* graphs because the task dependencies have a specific order In the morning routine example, the task *make bed* depends on completing the *get out of bed* task. The following show *undirected* and *directed* graphs representing the relationships between the two tasks. \n",

    "Finally, workflows are *acyclic*, meaning that the workflow graph does not contain any loops. A loop occurs when two tasks mutually depend on each other. The instructions on many shampoo bottles, \"lather, rinse, repeat\", is an example of a cyclic workflow. If you literally followed these instructions, you would start by lathering your hair, then rinsing your hair, followed by repeating the cycle for all eternity. While any sane human being would stop this cycle at a certain point, computers tend to take such instructions quite literally. As a consequence, workflow engines avoid jobs with cyclic workflows. \n",

    "With definitions out of the way, we can take our morning routine and define a DAG-based workflow. When describing the dependencies between tasks, we do not need to define every dependency between every task. For instance, we know that we need to wake up before we exercise and that we need to exercise before we shower. Therefore, we only need to define exercising as a dependency for showering and not waking up. We assume if exercising is a dependency for showering, then we will execute all of the tasks necessary for exercising before showering.\n",

    "Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are critical when designing both batch and streaming workflows. From Cookiecutter Data Science's section on [Analysis is a DAG](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/#analysis-is-a-dag): \n",
    "\n",
    "> Often in an analysis you have long-running steps that preprocess data or train models. If these steps have been run already (and you have stored the output somewhere like the data/interim directory), you don't want to wait to rerun them every time. \n",
    "\n",

    "There are multiple tools for creating and running DAG-based workflows including Python-focused tools such as [Paver](http://paver.github.io/paver/#), [Luigi](http://luigi.readthedocs.org/en/stable/index.html), [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/index.html), [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [Ruffus](http://www.ruffus.org.uk/), or [Joblib](https://pythonhosted.org/joblib/memory.html)). [Oozie](http://oozie.apache.org/) and [Azkaban](https://azkaban.github.io/) are other open source workflow tools focused on Hadoop. \n",
    "\n",
    "While these tools are helpful when implementing production workflows, we will not be using any of them in this assignment to avoid unnecessary complexity. Instead, we will design the workflow as DAG using the [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/)  library. The [NetworkX tutorial](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/tutorial.html) and [NetworkX introduction](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/introduction.html) provide helpful guides to working with graphs, nodes, and edges. \n",
    "\n",
    "We represent the overall workflow as a NetworkX [DiGraph](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/classes/digraph.html). We use *nodes* to define tasks and datasets and use *edges* to represent the relationship between tasks and datasets. Because a workflow is a directed graph, the edge direction is essential.  If an edge starts at a task and ends at a dataset, the dataset is an output of the task. If an edge starts at a dataset and ends at a task, the dataset is a task input. \n",
